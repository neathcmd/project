              MY CODING JOURNEY: BUILDING MY FIRST WEBSITE

            <h5 class="years">2024</h5>
            <hr />
            <p>
              In 2024, I embarked on my journey into the world of web
              development. I started learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and
              JavaScript, which gave me the foundation to build my first
              website. It was a simple personal portfolio where I showcased my
              skills, projects, and interests.
            </p>

            <h5 class="years">The Challenges</h5>
            <hr />
            <p>
              One of the biggest challenges I faced was understanding the Document Object 
              Model (DOM) and how JavaScript could interact with it. Initially, I struggled 
              with manipulating HTML elements dynamically, but after a lot of practice, 
              I finally grasped concepts like event listeners and DOM manipulation.

            <hr />
            <p>
              The final product was a clean, responsive portfolio website. 
              Although it wasn't anything too fancy, it was a huge achievement for me.
              I was proud of the fact that I was able to take what I learned and apply 
              it to create something functional and personal.

              EXPANDING MY SKILLS: LEARNING Frontend DEVELOPMENT

            <p>
              In 2025, I took the leap into Frontend development. 
              I decided to learn react js and bootstrap to build web applications. 
              I also delved into Backend, learning Node.js and how to connect a frontend to a backend.

            <hr />
            <p>
              Building a simple website was a game-changer. 
              With Javacript and React js, I could create an interactive website, 
              The learning curve was steep, especially with asynchronous programming and promises, 
              but I found the process exciting.
            </p>

            <hr />
            <h5 class="years">The Results</h5>
            <hr />
            <p>
              After weeks of learning and experimenting, 
              I managed to build a basic but functional 
              website that could interact with the user.
              This new skill set opened up opportunities 
              to develop a web applications.

              Looking forward, my goal is to master React and Bootstrao for building dynamic,

              such as Python with Django, and learn more about DevOps practices to manage 
              the deployment of my applications.

              (made up of pixels), vector graphics in Illustrator are created
              using mathematical paths, making them infinitely scalable without 
              losing quality.
